# Hangman game
Hangman game was very interesting game to make, it was very difficult because of a lot of new methods i used.
#The game itself was not that hard, the main problems were list and the other methods that are new for me. 
## Input file
Game takes all words from file named words.txt, i put 50 russian words in it, so it can be game for American people who are trying to improve their russian speaking skills haha.
## Design choises 
There's no design choices but i used different methods for different crowds of code which are doing the same function for better looking
